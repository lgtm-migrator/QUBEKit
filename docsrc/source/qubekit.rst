What is QUBEKit?
QUBEKit is a Python 3.6+ based force field derivation toolkit for Linux operating systems. Our aims are to allow users to quickly derive molecular mechanics parameters directly from quantum mechanical calculations. QUBEKit pulls together multiple pre-existing engines, as well as bespoke methods to produce accurate results with minimal user input. QUBEKit aims to avoid fitting to experimental data where possible while also being highly customisable.
