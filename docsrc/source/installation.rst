Installation
============

Linux / MacOS
-------------

For conda installation, please use the provided environment file *env.yml*:

.. code-block:: Bash

    conda install qubekit -c conda-forge

Alternatively, you can install the dependancies manually in the env.yml and use pip to install the package:

.. code-block:: Bash

    cd qubekit
    pip install .

..

    WARNING: Note the issue with PSI4 as the clash between the conda channels defaults and conda-forge.

Windows
-------

It is still there.
