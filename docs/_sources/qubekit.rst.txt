What is QUBEKit?
----------------

QUBEKit (https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/danielcole/qube-force-field) is a Python 3.6+ based force field derivation toolkit for Linux operating systems.
Our aims are to allow users to quickly derive molecular mechanics parameters directly
from quantum mechanical calculations. QUBEKit pulls together multiple pre-existing engines,
as well as bespoke methods to produce accurate results with minimal user input.
QUBEKit aims to avoid fitting to experimental data where possible while also being highly customisable.

Users who have used QUBEKit to derive force field parameters should
cite the following references (also given in the `CITATION.cff` file):

In Development
--------------

While QUBEKit is stable we are constantly working to improve the code and broaden its compatibilities.

We use software written by many people; if reporting a bug, please (to the best of your ability) make
sure it is a bug with QUBEKit and not with a dependency. We welcome any suggestions,
issues or pull requests for additions or changes.
