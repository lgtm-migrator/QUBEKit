Staging Classes
===============

Here we present in the correct order the different stages which QUBEKit executes. In each stage only one of the available tools can be use to carry out the main operation. For example, for parametrisation either AnteChamber of OpenFF can be utilised. Each of these can be imported and used on its, which is why we provide here the API for each of the classes.
